## Setup and Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Portfolio
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

4.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
    This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

5.  **Preview the production build:**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    # or
    yarn preview
    # or
    pnpm preview
